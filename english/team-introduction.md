# ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ Team Introduction

The BTCJAPAN team is composed of three visionary and talented Japanese entrepreneurs who together have created this unique platform.

Ryunosuke Tanaka is a vibrant and innovative young entrepreneur passionate about AI and Crypto technologies. Since university, he has dreamed of creating a platform that integrates cutting-edge technologies to change the way people communicate. The concept for BTCJAPAN originated when he decided to invest his planned graduate school tuition fees into the cryptocurrency market, buying Bitcoin at $23,000 and holding it until it reached $69,000.

He has since given up his pursuit of a graduate degree at Waseda University to fully dedicate himself to the BTCJAPAN venture.
